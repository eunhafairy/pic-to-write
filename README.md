pic-to-write

write to a pdf file! developed with my own personal requirement in mind

1. git clone this
2. install modules
3. set URL_TO_TEMPLATE_PDF env variable where it's a link to a PDF form with appropriate text form names as you have in the csv column
4. run "npm i -g ." in the cwd
5. go to a directory where your csv file is saved.
6. run "pic-to-write --file [path to your csv file] --identifer [your key identifier]

this is super specific to me so edit as you wish whatever
